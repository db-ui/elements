DB UI Elements is a library, that provides style conform UI components for Deutsche Bahn web
frontends. It's designed to work with any web framework — or even without one.

## How to consume

Find a here a detailed [how to consume](doc/howto-start.md) for your development context, either vanilla JavaScript or any framework – we're proving "native" framework components for Angular, React and Vue.

## Core principals

### Framework agnostic

DB UI Elements is built on native Web Standards and can be used in any web framework like (Angular, React, Vuejs) or even without one. The underlying technology is Web Components, which is a set of native Web Standards that work together, letting you create custom elements that work just like the standard HTML elements built into your browser.

### Compliant to Deutsche Bahn UI/UX guidelines

DB UI Elements follows the Deutsche Bahn UI/UX guidelines.
[See more details Styling](/doc/howto-style.md)

### Multi-tenant

Every tenant in Deutsche Bahn has a deviation from corporate style.  
We separate style from implementation. So that the consumer can decide, which tenant style to support.
It is also possible to use multiple styles in the same application, just by switching the configuration.

The style is provided by [DB UI Core](https://github.com/db-ui/core)

Currently we support following tenants:

* Regular (DB UX Design System)
* Enterprise

Other tenants can be added -> please contact us

### Accessible

Web Components are a set of technologies that work together, letting you create custom elements that work just like the standard HTML elements built into your browser.

### Light weight

DB UI Elements Web Components are implemented using StencilJS, which is designed for creating web components with a minimum amount of overhead.

### Open and free to use

DB UI Elements is free (Apache 2.0 license) to consume and is community driven.
If you miss a component than [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md), please.
