## Before you commit

Moreover, you need to duplicate ``.env.template`` as ``.env`` and type your own email address. This ensures that you have the correct email set for this project.

### Conventions

Please be aware that we have some [code and git commit (message and branch naming) conventions](doc/conventions.adoc), that we ensure with some linting tools.
