If you'd like to test your commit message previous to using it, you could test it on the command line:
....
echo 'foo: bar' | commitlint
....

## Code conventions

The general code conventions are guaranteed by the following tools.

### Through configuration files: `.editorconfig` for IDEs and `.gitattributes` for git checkins
Both the link:https://editorconfig.org/[`.editorconfig`] and link:https://dev.to/deadlybyte/please-add-gitattributes-to-your-git-repository-1jld[`.gitattributes`] ensure a consistent code structure and conventions through their configurations.

### prettier
The link:adr/code_style_formatter-prettier.adoc[prettier] tool provides a general code prettfying.
