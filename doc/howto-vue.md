# Get started with Vue

## Purpose

You are an Application Developer and you want to use DB UI Elements in your own Vue app.

## How to install

[Read the "How to Start" documentation](https://github.com/db-ui/elements/blob/main/doc/howto-start.md).


### Integrate in your app


Import a db-ui-elements component into a vue component (*.vue) like this:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import {
  DbButton,
} from '@db-ui/v-elements-enterprise/dist/components';
...
</script>
```

| WARNING: Some components require fonts and/or icons to work properly |
| --- |
 You can import fonts and icons with the provided css file from DB UI Core:

``import "@db-ui/core/dist/css/db-ui-core.vars.css"``

Import this css before you use components. For example you could import it inside your ``main.ts`` file.

### Bundle your App

If you use vite there are some issues with building here are some issues we had to solve:

````typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  ...
  resolve: {
    dedupe: ['vue'], // <-- this is required for vite build
  ...
  },
  server: {
    fs: {
      strict: false // <-- was required to start dev
    }
  }
});
````


### Test if it works

In order to test the installation just add a component to your ``<template>``:

```html
<template>
  <DbButton>Hi from Vue!</DbButton>
</template>
```

### Events

We add `v-model` support which fires on every change.
But you can use normal `@` events as well.

Both Inputs in this example do the same:

````html
<script setup lang="ts">
  import {
    DbInput,
  } from '@db-ui/v-elements-enterprise/dist/components';
  import { ref } from 'vue';
  const input = ref('');
</script>
<template>
  <DbInput
    label="Inputfield"
    name="input-name"
    v-model="input"
  ></DbInput>
  <DbInput
    label="Inputfield"
    name="input-name"
    :value=input 
    @change="e => input = e.target.value"
  ></DbInput>  
</template>
````
