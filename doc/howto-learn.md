# How to learn

You want better understand how web components and design systems works?
These ressources we used to learn and get inspired for DB UI Elements

## Web Components

### Blaze

Blaze is very special because it has similar construct:

- [Blaze CSS](http://blazecss.com/) -> DB UI Core
- [Blaze atoms](https://www.blazeui.com/) -> DB UI Elements
- Blaze atoms consumes Blaze CSS, which would be equal to our solution
- Blaze use Stencil
