This project is for reference how to use DB UI Elements with vanilla React. We're also [hosting the build on GitHub pages](https://db-ui.github.io/elements/react-showcase/index.html).

## Installation

Because of the monorepo architecture of DB UI Elements the installation of the showcase is a little bit finicky.
No `node_modules` folders should be present in all of the repository when you install the dependencies of the React showcase in the `showcase/react-showcase` folder:

    cd showcase/react-showcase
    npm i

Only afterwards you should install the dependencies of DB UI Elements in the root folder of the repository:

    cd ../../
    npm i

Then start the automatic compilation of the DB UI Elements web components and create-react-app in the React showcase:

    npm run start:showcase
    cd showcase/react-showcase
    npm start

Changes in the DB UI Elements web components should now be instantly reflected in the React showcase as well.

## Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
